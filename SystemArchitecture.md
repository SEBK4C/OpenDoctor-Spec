# System Architecture

## Overview
Open Doctor is designed with a modular, privacy-focused architecture that ensures all patient data remains secure while enabling powerful AI-assisted medical history management. This document details the system's architecture, its core components, and how they work together.

## Core Components

### 1. System Portability

The system is engineered for full portability, enabling patients to securely store and manage their medical records directly on their own devices. This ensures patients maintain control of their private medical data while still benefiting from advanced AI capabilities.

#### Key Features

- **Portable Patient Data File System**
  - Secure local storage of all medical records
  - Standardized file formats for interoperability
  - Support for importing/exporting medical records from various healthcare providers
  - Built-in data integrity verification

- **Flexible Database Schema**
  - Optimized for diverse medical records
  - Support for structured and unstructured medical data
  - Schema evolution capabilities for adapting to changing medical standards
  - Efficient querying for medical timeline generation

- **Self-contained LLM Server Stack**
  - Local AI processing without relying on external services
  - Privacy-preserving natural language processing
  - Optimized for medical terminology and context
  - Support for offline operation with pre-downloaded models

### 2. Asynchronous Background Processes

The system employs asynchronous background processes to ensure data security and efficient operation without interrupting the core medical timeline. This architecture separates user-facing interactions from resource-intensive background tasks.

#### Process Management

- **Process Tasks File**
  - Definition of all required background tasks
  - Configuration for automatic or manual task initiation
  - Task prioritization and dependency management
  - Performance monitoring and optimization

- **Commissioning of Specific Tasks**
  - Support for tasks requiring advanced AI computation
  - Integration with human oversight workflows
  - Separation of task execution from timeline commits
  - Verification and validation procedures

#### Security and Access Control

- **Granular Permissions Management**
  - Detailed access control for sensitive medical data
  - Role-based permission system
  - Audit logging for all data access
  - Compliance with healthcare privacy regulations

- **Secure File System Traversal**
  - Robust mechanisms for safely navigating the file system
  - Path sanitization and validation
  - Prevention of directory traversal attacks
  - Encrypted data paths

#### API and Data Orchestration

- **Protected File Edit APIs**
  - Secure and controlled updates to medical records
  - Validation of all data modifications
  - Version control integration
  - Atomic operations for data consistency

- **Multi-Database Scheduler**
  - Efficient orchestration of tasks across multiple databases
  - Optimal data management and system performance
  - Resource allocation and prioritization
  - Failure recovery and resilience strategies

## System Integration

The architecture is designed for seamless integration between components while maintaining strict security boundaries:

1. **Frontend to Backend Communications**
   - Secure API gateway for all frontend requests
   - Authentication and authorization at multiple levels
   - Rate limiting and request validation

2. **Background Task Execution**
   - Isolated execution environments for tasks
   - Resource monitoring and management
   - Error handling and recovery procedures

3. **AI Model Integration**
   - Deterministic model execution for consistent results
   - Model versioning and update management
   - Validation of model outputs against medical standards

## Security Considerations

The architecture incorporates several layers of security:

- **Data Encryption**
  - End-to-end encryption for all sensitive data
  - Secure key management
  - Encrypted storage at rest

- **Access Control**
  - Device authentication options
  - Principle of least privilege
  - Session management and timeout controls

- **Audit and Compliance**
  - Comprehensive audit trails
  - Compliance with healthcare regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)
  - Regular security assessments

## Future Architecture Considerations

- **Federated Learning Support**
  - Privacy-preserving model improvements
  - Collaborative medical AI advancement without data sharing

- **Edge Computing Optimization**
  - Improved performance on limited hardware
  - Reduced resource consumption for mobile devices

- **Interoperability Extensions**
  - Support for additional healthcare data standards
  - Integration with electronic health record systems
