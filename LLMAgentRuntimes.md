# LLM Agent Runtimes

## Overview

The LLM (Large Language Model) Agent Runtimes in Open Doctor are the core AI components that power the system's medical analysis, knowledge retrieval, and patient interaction capabilities. These runtimes are designed with a focus on determinism, reliability, and medical accuracy, ensuring consistent and trustworthy AI-assisted healthcare experiences.

## Deterministic Nature

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All doctors will be tested on deterministic outputs - temperature values are levels of statistically bound randomness. For this reason, all tests will be written with temperature value zero. Or use predefined temperature Seed values.  (difficult for when models are provided by external API calls.)

### Core Deterministic Principles

The deterministic nature of Open Doctor's LLM agents is a fundamental design principle that ensures consistent and reliable medical advice:

- **Temperature Control**
  - Hardcoded temperature seed values for all generation
  - Zero temperature setting for maximum determinism
  - Consistent sampling strategies across all models
  - Verification of output stability

- **Prompt Engineering**
  - Hardcoded prompt templates for all interactions
  - Strict input validation and normalization
  - Consistent system messages and context
  - Versioned prompt libraries with compatibility guarantees

- **Tool Execution**
  - Hardcoded tool definitions and behaviors
  - Deterministic API calling patterns
  - Consistent error handling procedures
  - Versioned tool interfaces

### Deterministic Guarantee

> [!NOTE]
> Deterministic : Given the same input tokens, a doctor agent will need to always generate the same output tokens 100% of the time. 

This guarantee enables several critical features:

- **Reproducible Diagnoses**
  - Consistent medical advice for identical inputs
  - Ability to audit and review AI-generated content
  - Support for second opinions and verification
  - Elimination of random variations in medical guidance

- **Testable Behavior**
  - Comprehensive test suites with expected outputs
  - Automated validation of model behavior
  - Regression testing for all updates
  - Certification against medical standards

- **Regulatory Compliance**
  - Verifiable and explainable AI decisions
  - Audit trails for all medical advice
  - Consistent behavior across all installations
  - Evidence-based validation process

## Testing Requirements

> [!TODO]
> - [ ] Test Tool APIs with Deterministic "dummy data" Implement on MCP_test servers
> - [ ] Validate LLM determinism in practice, identify and eliminate
