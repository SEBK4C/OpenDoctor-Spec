# ICD Vectorization for Open Doctor - NLP Student Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a vector database and search system for the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) database, enabling natural language querying for medical conditions and appropriate interventions. This work is part of the larger Open Doctor project, which provides AI-powered medical assistance while maintaining patient privacy through local processing.

## Getting Started

1. Review the [Project Overview](./ProjectOverview.md) to understand the overall goals
2. Read your specific role document to understand your responsibilities
3. Study the [Technical Architecture](./TechnicalArchitecture.md) for system design details
4. Look at the [Sample Code](./SampleCode.md) for implementation starting points
5. Participate in the first team meeting to discuss approach and assignments

## Core Technologies

- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **FastAPI**: API framework
- **Vector Databases**: FAISS, Pinecone, or similar
- **Sentence Transformers**: For creating embeddings
- **ICD-11 API**: WHO's International Classification of Diseases API
- **GitHub**: For code storage and collaboration
- **Docker**: For containerization and deployment

## Communication

Team members should establish regular communication channels and meeting schedules. All code and documentation should be maintained in a shared GitHub repository to facilitate collaboration and version control.
