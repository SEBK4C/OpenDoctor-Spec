# Developer Tools

## Overview

Open Doctor provides a suite of developer tools designed to support the creation, management, and validation of AI components within the system. These tools ensure consistent and secure AI processing while maintaining the highest standards of medical accuracy and reliability.

## Core Developer Tools

### 1. Open Doctor LLM Agent Runtime MAKER

This tool is responsible for packaging and validating the LLM (Large Language Model) agents used within the Open Doctor system. It ensures consistent, reproducible, and secure AI processing across all instances of the application.

#### Key Features

- **Dependency Packaging**
  - Consolidates all Open Doctor agent dependencies into a single binary
  - Eliminates version conflicts and dependency issues
  - Ensures consistent runtime environment across all installations
  - Simplifies deployment and updates

- **Secure Hashing**
  - Generates cryptographically secure file hashes for all components
  - Enables verification of binary integrity
  - Creates signed attestations for trusted model provenance
  - Prevents tampering with AI model components

- **Deterministic Processing**
  - Implements deterministic model execution patterns
  - Ensures reproducible results for medical queries
  - Manages model parameters for consistent outputs
  - Supports audit trails for all AI-generated content

#### Technical Implementation

- **Containerization**
  - Docker-based packaging for consistent environments
  - Multi-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows)
  - Minimal runtime footprint for efficient execution

- **Version Management**
  - Semantic versioning for all agent runtimes
  - Controlled update pathways
  - Backward compatibility guarantees
  - Deprecation policies and migration tools

- **Specialty Certification**
  - Domain-specific validations (cardiology, radiology, general practice, etc.)
  - Graduated levels of permission within each specialty
  - Performance thresholds for certification maintenance
  - Continuous evaluation against medical standards

#### System Integration

- **Background Scheduler Integration**
  - Registration of model qualifications with scheduler
  - Permission enforcement during task allocation
  - Automated qualification checks before task execution
  - Audit logging of permission utilization

- **Tool Database Management**
  - Centralized repository of medical tools and interventions
  - Permission mapping for each tool
  - Usage analytics and effectiveness tracking
  - Version control for tool definitions
