2. **Embedding Pipeline Implementation**
   - Develop a process to convert ICD codes and descriptions to vector embeddings
   - Implement batch processing for large-scale vector creation
   - Optimize embedding quality for medical terminology
   - Create an efficient storage and retrieval system for vectors

3. **Search Algorithm Development**
   - Implement similarity search algorithms
   - Optimize for both accuracy and performance
   - Develop ranking mechanisms for search results
   - Create a modular system that allows for future improvements

## Required Skills

## Contribution to Open Doctor Project

Your work on vector embeddings and search is critical to making medical knowledge accessible through natural language queries. This enables patients to describe symptoms in their own words and receive relevant medical information, a core capability of the Open Doctor project. The vector database you create will form the backbone of the system's ability to understand and respond to patient queries with accurate medical information.
