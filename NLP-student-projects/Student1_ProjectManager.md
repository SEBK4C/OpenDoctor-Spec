# Project Manager & API Designer Role

## Role Overview

As the Project Manager & API Designer, you will be responsible for coordinating the team's efforts and designing the API that will serve as the interface between the vector database and client applications. You will ensure that deliverables are met on time, facilitate communication between team members, and make key architectural decisions.

## Key Responsibilities

1. **Project Management**
   - Coordinate team activities and track progress
   - Facilitate regular team meetings and communication
   - Manage GitHub repository organization and access
   - Ensure deliverables meet requirements and deadlines
   - Identify and mitigate risks early

2. **API Design**
   - Design RESTful API endpoints for vector search
   - Define request/response schemas for all endpoints
   - Document API using OpenAPI/Swagger
   - Ensure API design follows best practices
   - Consider rate limiting, authentication, and security

3. **System Integration**
   - Integrate the vector database with the FastAPI server
   - Connect the ICD code extraction with vector embedding process
   - Ensure diagnosis-to-intervention linking works correctly
   - Coordinate with other team members on interface definitions

## Required Skills

- Strong understanding of RESTful API design principles
- Experience with FastAPI or similar Python web frameworks
- Basic knowledge of vector databases and search algorithms
- Excellent communication and project management skills
- Familiarity with Git and GitHub workflows

## Tasks and Timeline

### Week 1 (April 19-25)
- [x] Set up GitHub repository structure
- [ ] Define API endpoints and documentation format
- [ ] Create project plan with detailed milestones
- [ ] Coordinate research efforts across team
- [ ] Establish communication channels and meeting schedule

### Week 2 (April 26-May 2)
- [ ] Implement skeleton FastAPI application
- [ ] Create API endpoints with mock responses
- [ ] Review progress with team and adjust timeline if needed
- [ ] Begin integration of vector database with API

### Week 3 (May 3-9)
- [ ] Complete API implementation
- [ ] Coordinate integration testing
- [ ] Ensure all components work together
- [ ] Review API performance and make adjustments

### Week 4 (May 10-16)
- [ ] Finalize API documentation
- [ ] Conduct final system testing
- [ ] Prepare project demo
- [ ] Coordinate final report creation
- [ ] Ensure all code is properly documented and tested

## Deliverables

1. **Project Management**
   - Project plan with milestones
   - Regular status updates
   - Final project report coordination

2. **API Design**
   - OpenAPI/Swagger specification
   - API endpoint implementation
   - API documentation
   - Authentication and security implementation (if required)

3. **System Integration**
   - Integrated system with all components working together
   - Performance metrics for API response times
   - Deployment documentation

## Tips for Success

- Start with a clear API design before implementation to avoid rework
- Use GitHub's project management features to track tasks
- Set up automatic testing early to catch integration issues
- Regular check-ins with team members help identify problems early
- Document decisions and design choices as you go

## Connections to Other Roles

- Work closely with the [Vector Database Engineer](./Student3_VectorDB.md) to ensure the API can efficiently query the vector database
- Coordinate with the [ICD Database Specialist](./Student2_ICDSpecialist.md) to ensure proper representation of ICD codes in the API
- Collaborate with the [Testing Specialist](./Student5_Testing.md) to establish testing protocols for the API
- Support the [Documentation Specialist](./Student6_Documentation.md) with accurate API documentation

## Contribution to Open Doctor Project

Your work will provide the foundation for how the Open Doctor project interfaces with the ICD database. This API will allow patients to describe symptoms in natural language and receive appropriate medical codes and interventions, a critical component of the overall system.
