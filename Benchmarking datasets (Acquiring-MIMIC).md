# Benchmarking Datasets: MIMIC Database Access

## Overview
This document outlines the process and requirements for acquiring access to the MIMIC (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) database for benchmarking medical AI models.

## Resources
- [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org)
- [MIT-LCP GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MIT-LCP)
- [MIMIC Documentation](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/)

## Requirements Note

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The best medical datasets are behind research credential walls. Medical researcher credentials are required for application approval.

### Purpose
- Develop proper benchmarks for AI Model medical credentials
- Vet models used within Open Doctor tools
- Create a scoring certification system

### Benchmarking Process
1. **Model Evaluation**
   - Present specific patient scenarios
   - Model makes predictions about:
     - Required actions
     - Tools to use
     - Tests to perform

2. **Benchmark Evaluation**
   - Evaluator checks MIMIC data for relevant tests
   - Results are provided back to the model
   - Model makes subsequent decisions

3. **Credentialing**
   - Points awarded for correct diagnoses
   - Models ranked by medical category (e.g., cardiology, radiology, intensive care)
   - Vetted models registry with SHA-hashes will be publicly available
   - Vetting methodology will be open source

> [!NOTE]
> MIMIC datasets do not need to be open-sourced to provide value in making AI health significantly safer for public and medical use.
