# ICD Database Specialist Role

## Role Overview

As the ICD Database Specialist, you will be responsible for understanding and working with the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) database. Your role involves extracting data from the WHO's ICD API, understanding the structure and relationships of medical codes, and preparing this data for vectorization and search functionality.

## Key Responsibilities

1. **ICD-11 Database Research**
   - Study the structure of the ICD-11 database
   - Understand the hierarchy and relationships between medical codes
   - Research how symptoms, diseases, and conditions are classified
   - Document the database schema and important entities

2. **Data Extraction**
   - Implement code to extract data from the ICD-11 API
   - Handle API authentication and rate limiting
   - Design a local caching system for ICD data
   - Create a structured dataset of ICD codes and descriptions

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Clean and normalize ICD descriptions and terms
   - Extract relevant features for vectorization
   - Develop a pipeline for processing ICD data
   - Prepare data in a format suitable for vector embedding

## Required Skills

- Strong understanding of RESTful APIs and HTTP
- Experience with data extraction and ETL processes
- Python programming skills
- Knowledge of data structures and JSON processing
- Basic understanding of medical terminology (beneficial)

## Tasks and Timeline

### Week 1 (April 19-25)
- [ ] Research ICD-11 database structure and API
- [ ] Create documentation on ICD code hierarchy
- [ ] Set up API access and authentication
- [ ] Develop initial data extraction script
- [ ] Test API endpoints and understand response formats

### Week 2 (April 26-May 2)
- [ ] Complete data extraction from ICD-11 API
- [ ] Implement data cleaning and normalization
- [ ] Create a structured dataset of codes and descriptions
- [ ] Document relationships between different ICD entities
- [ ] Begin integration with the vector database process

### Week 3 (May 3-9)
- [ ] Finalize data preprocessing pipeline
- [ ] Support vector database creation with processed data
- [ ] Develop method to keep ICD data updated
- [ ] Test data extraction with edge cases
- [ ] Create documentation on data formats

### Week 4 (May 10-16)
- [ ] Support integration testing
- [ ] Finalize documentation on ICD data structure
- [ ] Create visualizations of ICD code relationships
- [ ] Prepare final dataset for project submission
- [ ] Document any known limitations or future improvements

## Deliverables

1. **ICD Database Documentation**
   - Detailed documentation of ICD-11 structure
   - Description of code hierarchies and relationships
   - Visual representation of code organization

2. **Data Extraction Code**
   - Python scripts for ICD-11 API interaction
   - Authentication and error handling implementation
   - Data caching mechanisms

3. **Processed Dataset**
   - Clean, structured dataset of ICD codes and descriptions
   - Documentation of data schema
   - Statistics on the dataset (number of codes, categories, etc.)

## Tips for Success

- Start by thoroughly understanding the ICD-11 API documentation
- Create small test scripts to validate API responses before building the full extraction pipeline
- Document your process and discoveries as you go
- Consider how the data will be used by the vector database when designing your extraction process
- Collaborate closely with the Vector Database Engineer to ensure data compatibility
