# Medical Interventions Specialist Role

## Role Overview

As the Medical Interventions Specialist, you will focus on researching, collecting, and structuring data related to medical interventions and treatments. Your role involves identifying relevant medical intervention codes, creating connections between diagnoses and appropriate treatments, and building a vector database of interventions that complements the ICD disease database.

## Key Responsibilities

1. **Medical Intervention Research**
   - Research available intervention coding systems (e.g., ICHI, CPT, HCPCS)
   - Understand the structure and organization of medical interventions
   - Identify relationships between diagnoses and treatments
   - Document sources and standards for intervention data

2. **Intervention Data Collection**
   - Extract and compile intervention codes and descriptions
   - Create a structured dataset of medical interventions
   - Develop a consistent format for intervention data
   - Link interventions to relevant ICD codes

3. **Vector Database Integration**
   - Prepare intervention data for vectorization
   - Work with the Vector Database Engineer to embed intervention data
   - Develop methods for matching diagnoses to appropriate interventions
   - Test and evaluate intervention recommendations

## Required Skills

- Understanding of medical terminology and healthcare processes
- Research skills for identifying authoritative medical sources
- Data organization and structuring abilities
- Python programming skills
- Basic understanding of vector databases and embeddings

## Tasks and Timeline

### Week 1 (April 19-25)
- [ ] Research medical intervention coding systems
- [ ] Document intervention data sources and structures
- [ ] Set up access to necessary medical resources
- [ ] Create initial schema for intervention data
- [ ] Begin collecting sample intervention data

### Week 2 (April 26-May 2)
- [ ] Complete initial intervention dataset
- [ ] Create mapping between ICD codes and interventions
- [ ] Develop data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline
- [ ] Begin structuring data for vectorization
- [ ] Test intervention retrieval with sample queries

### Week 3 (May 3-9)
- [ ] Finalize intervention dataset
- [ ] Support vector embedding of intervention data
- [ ] Implement linking between diagnoses and interventions
- [ ] Test accuracy of intervention recommendations
- [ ] Document intervention data structure and relationships

### Week 4 (May 10-16)
- [ ] Support integration testing
- [ ] Finalize documentation on intervention data
- [ ] Create visualizations of diagnosis-intervention relationships
- [ ] Prepare final dataset for project submission
- [ ] Document limitations and future improvement areas

## Deliverables

1. **Intervention Dataset**
   - Structured data of medical interventions
   - Documentation of data schema and format
   - Statistics on the dataset (number of interventions, categories, etc.)

2. **Diagnosis-Intervention Mappings**
   - Documentation of relationships between ICD codes and interventions
   - Code for matching diagnoses to appropriate treatments
   - Evaluation of mapping accuracy

3. **Intervention Search Functionality**
   - Integration with vector database for intervention search
   - Methods for retrieving relevant interventions based on diagnoses
   - Documentation of search process and limitations

## Tips for Success

- Focus on high-quality, authoritative sources for medical intervention data
- Start with a manageable subset of interventions before scaling to the full dataset
- Document your methodology for creating diagnosis-intervention links
- Test your mappings with medical examples to ensure accuracy
- Collaborate closely with the ICD Database Specialist to ensure compatibility

## Connections to Other Roles

- Coordinate with the [ICD Database Specialist](./Student2_ICDSpecialist.md) to understand disease classification
- Work with the [Vector Database Engineer](./Student3_VectorDB.md) to ensure intervention data can be properly vectorized
- Provide intervention-related API requirements to the [Project Manager & API Designer](./Student1_ProjectManager.md)
- Support the [Testing Specialist](./Student5_Testing.md) with test cases for intervention recommendations

## Contribution to Open Doctor Project

Your work will enable the Open Doctor project to not only identify medical conditions based on patient symptoms but also suggest appropriate interventions and treatments. This creates a complete loop from symptom to diagnosis to treatment, providing patients with comprehensive medical guidance. By establishing reliable links between conditions and interventions, you contribute to a system that can genuinely assist patients in understanding their medical options.
