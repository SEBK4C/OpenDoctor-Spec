## Implementation Considerations

### Integration Priority
1. MedlinePlus - For general patient education
2. UMLS - For comprehensive terminology mapping
3. SNOMED CT - For clinical documentation
4. ICD-11 - For diagnosis coding
5. RxNorm - For medication information

### Usage Guidelines
- Use patient-friendly resources when generating explanations for users
- Leverage technical medical dictionaries for backend accuracy and clinical documentation
- Provide cross-references between technical terms and their plain language equivalents
- Include pronunciation guides for complex medical terminology

### Access Requirements
- Some resources require licensing or registration (SNOMED CT, UMLS)
- Implementation should include proper attribution as required by each resource
- API access should be configured with appropriate rate limiting

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with multilingual medical dictionaries
- Development of a specialized dictionary for the Open Doctor system
- Creation of a visual medical terminology database with images and diagrams
- Implementation of an ontology mapping system between different dictionary systems
