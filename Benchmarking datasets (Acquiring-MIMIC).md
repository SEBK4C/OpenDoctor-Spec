The best data sets are behind research credential walls.. 
I'm going to need to find medical researchers who can credential my applications. 
- I need this medical data for developing proper benchmarks and "AI Model medical credentials". 
- Models used within the Open Doctor tools need to be vetted. This vetting process should assign a score certification for the following: 
- It's best to develop this credential/ benchmark using actual medical data, 
	- Showing specific patient scenarios - 
		- Having a specific model make predictions about which actions to take in which tools to use and which tests to have done on the patient.
		- Benchmark Evaluator: Checks if the patient had any of those relevant tests from the MIMIC and provides those back to the model to see what it will do next. 
		- if the MIMIC Patient is diagnosed correctly by the AI Model, then the receives credential points for Medical category it was evaluated on. Given enough points the model is ranked for use in that Medical category. (eg. cardiology, radiology, intensive care... )
- A Vetted Models registry and SHA-hashes will be open publicly, the methodology used for vetting will also be fully open source, MIMIC data sets don't need to be Open sourced for them to still add value making AI health significantly safer for public and medical use.

The contents of restricted-access clinical databases maintained by PhysioNet were derived from original data that contained protected health information (PHI), as defined by [HIPAA](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/hipaa/). The providers of the data have given scrupulous attention to the task of locating and removing all PHI, so that the remaining data can be considered [de-identified](http://privacyruleandresearch.nih.gov/pr_08.asp#8a) and therefore not subject to the HIPAA Privacy Rule restrictions on sharing PHI. Nevertheless, because of the richness and detail of the databases, the data will be released only to legitimate researchers under the terms and conditions described on this page.

Use this form to submit a data use agreement and request access to restricted-access clinical databases hosted on PhysioNet. Please be sure to provide all requested information. _Submissions that are clearly incomplete, incorrect, or frivolous will be rejected._
