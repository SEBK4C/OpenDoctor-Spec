## Contribution to Open Doctor Project

Your documentation will serve as the bridge between this project and the larger Open Doctor ecosystem. By creating clear, comprehensive guides and integration materials, you enable the vectorized ICD database to be effectively incorporated into the Open Doctor project. This documentation will also help future developers understand, maintain, and extend the system, ensuring the long-term value of the team's work.
