# Meeting Notes: Open Doctor Implementation at Naturopathic Clinic ( 2025-03-21)

## Overview

This document summarizes a recent conversation regarding the potential implementation of the Open Doctor system at a naturopathic clinic. The meeting focused on integrating our privacy-first medical history management tool with their existing infrastructure.

## Current Clinic Infrastructure

The clinic currently utilizes two primary digital tools for patient management:

- **SimpliMed** ([simplimed.de](https://www.simplimed.de)) - Their core practice management system handling patient scheduling, health histories, and clinical documentation
- **Doctolib** ([doctolib.de](https://www.doctolib.de)) - Supplementary appointment management platform

## Key Discussion Points

### Current Workflow Challenges

Doctolib and the clinical team outlined several pain points in their current workflow:

- Limited time for comprehensive patient history review
- Inefficient documentation procedures
- Desire for better flagging of critical blood test values
- Manual processing time of test results

### Open Doctor Integration Possibilities

We discussed potential integration points between Open Doctor and SimpliMed:

1. **Local Processing of Patient Data**
    - The clinic expressed strong interest in our privacy-first approach
    - Thomas (clinic administrator) emphasized that patient data must remain within the clinic premises
    - Our air-gapped implementation proposal aligned with their security requirements
2. **Automated Test Result Analysis**
    - High interest in the automatic flagging of abnormal blood test results
    - Potential to streamline their workflow by integrating these flags directly into SimpliMed patient records
3. **AI-Assisted Research Capabilities**
    - Proposed utilizing capabilities similar to OpenAI's deep research tools
    - Focus on maintaining patient privacy while providing state-of-the-art medical insights

## Implementation Concerns

Thomas remains cautiously optimistic but expressed several concerns:

- Data privacy must be absolutely guaranteed
- System prompts need to be tailored to practitioner needs
- Initial version should function entirely offline (air-gapped)
- Need for clear demonstration of value before full adoption

## Next Steps

1. **Initial Demo Planning**
    - Schedule an on-site demonstration at the clinic
    - Prepare an air-gapped version for the first trial
    - Focus on demonstrating the patient history chat functionality
2. **System Prompt Development**
    - Create specialized prompts for naturopathic medicine
    - Emphasize abnormal blood test result detection
    - Ensure outputs are clinically relevant
3. **Integration Strategy**
    - Design SimpliMed integration framework
    - Prioritize local operation with no external dependencies
    - Develop internet-dependent features as optional plugins

## Design Philosophy

Our approach aligns perfectly with the clinic's needs:

> "It is a design and moral philosophy to set up the system to be self-contained, not requiring Internet connection for initial operations. To develop all other operations that require interconnections as plugins thereafter."

This core principle of Open Doctor—prioritizing patient privacy through local processing—resonated strongly with the clinic's values and requirements.
